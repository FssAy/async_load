# Example
This example shows a very basic usage of the crate.

It spawns a new thread, waits 1 second and then creates a ds_map and dispatches it.

This code will not block the main game loop and will produce some data avaliable in the `Async - Social` event.

# GMS2
This folder contains the example GMS2 project that can be launched without any additional steps.
